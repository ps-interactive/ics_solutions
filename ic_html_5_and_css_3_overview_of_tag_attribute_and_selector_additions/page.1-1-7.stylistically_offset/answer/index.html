  group of art enthusiasts across the country.</b></p>
<p>The opening of the Art Gallery will coincide with the
  release of several of Armando Blontio's finest art pieces,
  including, "Crème de la Crème," which has a mounting
  anticipation for its debut.</p>
<p>As a frequently misrespresented artist, Armando Blontio
  has struggled to uphold his image amidst the criticism.
  "I hope to dispel the illusion of my self-centeredness,
  as seen by my critics, with the Art Gallery opening that
  shows a softer side of myself," said Mr. Blontio.</p>
